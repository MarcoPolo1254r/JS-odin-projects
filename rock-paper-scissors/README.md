# Rock Paper Scissors – Console Game

This project is a simple **Rock, Paper, Scissors** game built using **HTML and JavaScript**, played entirely through the 
**browser console**.

The game allows a human player to compete against the computer. The computer’s choice is generated randomly, while the human player provides input via a prompt. The game is played over multiple rounds, with scores tracked for both the human and the computer. At the end of the game, a winner is declared based on the final scores.

This assignment focuses on practicing core JavaScript concepts such as functions, variables, conditionals, user input, and basic program structure, as well as reinforcing good Git habits by committing early and often.

No additional HTML elements are required, as all interaction and output occur in the console.
